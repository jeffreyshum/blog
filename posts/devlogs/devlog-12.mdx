[Last week](/devlog-11), we added our core menus to our note-taking app built on Electron.
These menus describe the actions that can be performed by a user.
This week, we begin implementing the actions themselves, starting with the most important one: saving.

# A Quick Reminder

Let us take a moment to review the structure of the editor portion of our app.
In essence, everything depends on one single React `useEffect` hook, which is called whenever the state of the app changes.
Specifics can be found in [Devlog#10](/devlog-10).

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {6}
import { FC, useState } from "react"

...

const App: FC = () => {
    const [content, setContent] = useState("")

    return (
        <StyledAppContainer>
            <Editor value={content} 
                    onValueChange={(code) => setContent(code)} 
            />
            <Render content={content} />
        </StyledAppContainer>
    )
}

export default App
```

# Prompting The User 

The first thing we need to consider is how we will prompt the user to save their work.
Luckily for us, Electron has a built-in dialog box that we can use for this purpose.

To create a dialog box, we need to use the `dialog` module from Electron.
Our save dialogue will prompt the user with their system file explorer, allowing them to choose where to save their work, and what to name it.
The full path to the file will be returned to us as a string.

<CodeTitle name="App.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
import { dialog, BrowserWindow } from "electron"

const saveAs = async () => {
    const path = dialog.showSaveDialogSync(BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow(), {
		title: "Save",
		defaultPath: app.getPath("documents"),
		filters: [
			{
				name: "Markdown",
				extensions: ["md", "markdown"],
			},
		],
	})
}
```

Notice that we are providing a few options to the `showSaveDialogSync` function.
`defaultPath` is rather self-explanatory - it is the default path that the file explorer will open to.
Here we are using the system's `documents` directory.
`filters` is a list of file types that the user can choose from.
In this case, our app only supports Markdown files, so we are only allowing the appropriate file extensions.
A full list of options can be found [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/dialog#dialogshowsavedialogsyncbrowserwindow-options).

# Linking It Together

Now that we have the path to the file, we need to write the contents of the editor to our file.
To do this, we will need to find some way to pass data between the React and Electron components of our app.
While there are many ways to do this, with the suggested method of using Electron's event-based `ipcRenderer` module, we will be using something more rudimentary but easily accessible for web developers: the `localStorage` API.

The `localStorage` API is a simple key-value store that persists between sessions, which is perfect for our use case.
Let's use a `useEffect` hook to save the contents of the editor to `localStorage` whenever the user changes the contents of the editor.
We should also keep track of whether or not the user has saved their work.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {8-11}
import { FC, useState, useEffect } from "react"

...

const App: FC = () => {
    const [content, setContent] = useState("")

    useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem("content", content)
        localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
    }, [content])

    return (
        <StyledAppContainer>
            <Editor value={content} 
                    onValueChange={(code) => setContent(code)} 
            />
            <Render content={content} />
        </StyledAppContainer>
    )
}

export default App
```

Now, on the Electron side, we can fetch the contents of the editor from `localStorage` and write it to the file.
To do this, we will need to use the window's `executeJavaScript` function, which allows us to run JavaScript code in the window's context.
We will also need to use the `fs` module to write to the file.

<CodeTitle name="App.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts {5-10,23-28}
import { dialog, BrowserWindow } from "electron"
import fs from "fs"

const saveAs = async () => {
    const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
    if (!window) return

    const content = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('content')"
	)

    const path = dialog.showSaveDialogSync(BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow(), {
		title: "Save",
		defaultPath: app.getPath("documents"),
		filters: [
			{
				name: "Markdown",
				extensions: ["md", "markdown"],
			},
		],
	})

    if (path) {
		fs.writeFileSync(path, content)
		await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
			"localStorage.setItem('saved', 'true')"
		)
	}
}
```

Now, let us link our function to the menu item.

```ts
{
    label: "Save As",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+Shift+S",
    click: saveAs,
}
```

Now we can save our work! But, we are not done yet. 
What if we save our work, make some changes to it, and try to save it again?
In our current implementation, we will be prompted to save our work as a new file, instead of the expected behavior of overwriting the existing file.
To fix this, we will need to keep track of the path to the file that the user is currently working on.

```ts {6-8}
if (path) {
    fs.writeFileSync(path, content)
    await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
        "localStorage.setItem('saved', 'true')"
    )
    await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
        "localStorage.setItem('path', '" + path + "')"
    )
}
```

Now, we can check if the current file has a path associated with it, and if it does, we can overwrite the file instead of prompting the user to save it as a new file.

```ts
{
    label: "Save",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+S",
    click: async () => {
        const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
        const path = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
            "localStorage.getItem('path')"
        )

        if (path) {
            fs.writeFileSync(
                path,
                await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
                    "localStorage.getItem('content')"
                )
            )
        } else {
            saveAs()
        }
    },
}
```

Now we can save our work as many times as we want, and it will always be saved to the currently open file.

# Persisting A File 

Notice that a side effect of our current implementation is that we will be persisting the path to the file that the user last worked on.
We can use this to our advantage to automatically open that last file.
To do this, we will run a `useEffect` at the start of our app to check if there is a path to a file in `localStorage`.
If there is, we will open that file and set the contents of the editor to the contents of the file.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {13-19}
import { FC, useState, useEffect } from "react"

...

const App: FC = () => {
    const [content, setContent] = useState("")

    useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem("content", content)
        localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
    }, [content])

    useEffect(() => {
		const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")

		if (path) {
			setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
		}
	}, [])

    return (
        <StyledAppContainer>
            <Editor value={content} 
                    onValueChange={(code) => setContent(code)} 
            />
            <Render content={content} />
        </StyledAppContainer>
    )
}

export default App
```

Now, we can close our app, and when we open it again, it will automatically open the last file that we were working on.

As an extra quality of life improvement, let's also change the title of the window to the name of the file that we are currently working on.

```tsx {4}
useEffect(() => {
    const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")

    document.title = path?.split("/").pop() || "Untitled"

    if (path) {
        setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
    }
}, [])
```

And that's it! Next week, we will flesh out the look of our app, and maybe continue picking away at the menu items that we have yet to implement.

Until then.
