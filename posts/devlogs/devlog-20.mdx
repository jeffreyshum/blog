In the last two weeks, we have developed a basic framework for the backend of our productivity app.
This week, we will start working on the front end built with React Native so that we can have a means of interacting with the backend.

# React Native

React Native is a framework for building true native apps built on top of the React ecosystem.
With React Native, you can build apps for iOS, Android, and the web all with the same codebase.
The ideology is that you can write once and deploy your app wherever it needs to be.
For web developers, React Native is a great way to get into mobile development without having to learn native languages like Swift or Java/Kotlin for iOS and Android respectively.

To get started with React Native, we will use the [Expo quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) provided by React Native.
Expo is a set of tools and services that allow us to build, deploy, and quickly test our React Native apps.
 
For TypeScript support, we will use the following command to create our project:
    
```bash
npx create-expo-app --template
```

Let's also install additional packages that will allow us to easily navigate between different screens in our app:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

From here, we can start building our app.

# Simple Login Screen 

Let's start by creating a simple login screen, the functionality of which we will implement later.

<CodeTitle name="Login.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Pressable, Text } from "react-native"
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context"

const Login = () => {
	return (
    // SafeAreaView is a View component that ensures that the content
    // of our app is not hidden by the notch or any other system UI elements
    // View components are React Native's equivalent of divs
		<SafeAreaView>
			<Pressable>
				<Text>Login</Text>
			</Pressable>
		</SafeAreaView>
	)
}

export default Login
```

Now, to add this screen to our app, we will create a `Stack` at the root of our app and add the `Login` screen to it.
Let's also add some typing to our `Stack` so that we can pass in parameters to our screens later on.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native"
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/native-stack"
import Login from "./components/Login"

export type RootStackParamList = {
	Login: undefined
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<RootStackParamList>()

const App = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<NavigationContainer>
				<Stack.Navigator
					screenOptions={{
						headerShown: false,
					}}>
					<Stack.Screen name="Login" component={Login} />
				</Stack.Navigator>
			</NavigationContainer>
		</>
	)
}

export default App
```

Now, we can run our app through Expo and see our login screen. However, we can't navigate out of it yet.

# Navigating Between Screens

To navigate between screens, we will take advantage of the `navigation` prop that is implicitly passed to all screens.
This prop contains a `navigate` function that we can use to navigate to other screens.

Since we are using TypeScript, we will need to add some typing to our `navigation` prop. Let's also add some styling to our login screen.

<CodeTitle name="Login.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {3-4, 6, 8, 12, 20-33}
import { Pressable, StyleSheet, Text } from "react-native"
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context"
import { RootStackParamList } from "../App"
import { NativeStackScreenProps } from "@react-navigation/native-stack"

type Props = NativeStackScreenProps<RootStackParamList, "Login">

const Login = ({ navigation }: Props) => {
	return (
		<SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
			<Pressable
				onPress={() => navigation.navigate("Home")}
				style={styles.button}>
				<Text>Login</Text>
			</Pressable>
		</SafeAreaView>
	)
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
	container: {
		display: "flex",
		height: "100%",
		width: "100%",
		alignItems: "center",
		justifyContent: "center",
	},

	button: {
		backgroundColor: "lime",
		padding: 10,
	},
})

export default Login
```

Now, let's create a basic home screen.

<CodeTitle name="Home.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Text } from "react-native"
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context"

const Home = () => {
	return (
		<SafeAreaView>
			<Text>Home</Text>
		</SafeAreaView>
	)
}

export default Home
```

Now, we can add this screen to our `Stack` and test our navigation.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {4, 8, 22}
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native"
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/native-stack"
import Login from "./components/Login"
import Home from "./components/Home"

export type RootStackParamList = {
	Login: undefined
	Home: undefined
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<RootStackParamList>()

const App = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<NavigationContainer>
				<Stack.Navigator
					screenOptions={{
						headerShown: false,
					}}>
					<Stack.Screen name="Login" component={Login} />
					<Stack.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />
				</Stack.Navigator>
			</NavigationContainer>
		</>
	)
}

export default App
```

Now, when we press the login button we are taken to the home screen.

And that's it! We now have a basic way to navigate between screens in our app. Next week, we will use this navigation to implement the functionality of our app.

Until then.
