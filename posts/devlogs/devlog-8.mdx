# A Quick Reminder

Back in [Devlog #1](/devlog-1) we built out the core system for fetching and rendering posts like this one.
We leverage the power of mdx-bundler to parse mdx files into React components, and then use Next.js to generate static pages for each post.
The code we wrote looks like this.

<CodeTitle name="fetch_posts.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
import fs from "fs"
// This helps us parse the frontmatter for each post 
import matter from "gray-matter"

interface Post {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    originalDate: string;
    keywords: string;
    url: string;
    category: string;
}

const fetchPosts = () => {
    const recentPost: Array<Post> = []
    const posts = fs.readdirSync("posts")

	posts.forEach((post) => {
		const frontMatter = matter(fs.readFileSync(`posts/${post}`).toString())

		recentPosts.push({
			title: frontMatter.data.title,
			description: frontMatter.data.description,
			originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
			keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
			url: `/${post.replace(".mdx", "")}`,
			category: frontMatter.data.category,
		})
	})

    return recentPosts
}

```

While this implementation has certainly shown its worth to us and has powered this blog for quite a long time, it has a few obvious shortcomings.
First, it's not very flexible. In its current state, it only allows us to fetch posts that are located in a single directory (in this case, `posts`).
And secondly, it will break if we ever add a file that isn't an mdx file to the `posts` directory, which makes it exponentially a burden as we add more posts.

# Enter Globs 

Globs are a way to match files and directories to a pattern, similar to regex. For example, if we wanted to find all the files in a directory that end with `.png`, we could use the glob `*.png`.
Here, the single asterisk means we can have anything before the `.png`, which will match all the files that end with `.png`.
We can also use multiple asterisks to match multiple directories, for example, `**/*.png` will match all the files that end with `.png` in the current directory and all subdirectories.
This is useful for us, as we can use globs to match all the files in the `posts` directory, and then filter out the ones that don't end with `.mdx`, while simultaneously matching all the files in subdirectories, affording us some organizational freedom.

To use globs in JavaScript, we will need to use a library called [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob), which is the most popular library for supporting globs.
We can install it like so:
    
```bash
npm install glob

# or

yarn add glob
```

Now, we can use the glob library to fetch all the files in the `posts` directory, and then filter out the ones that don't end with `.mdx`.
Here's what the code looks like.

<CodeTitle name="fetch_posts.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
import fs from "fs"
import matter from "gray-matter"
import glob from "glob"

const fetchPosts = () => {
	const recentPosts: Array<Post> = []

	const files = glob.sync("posts" + "/**/*.mdx")

	files.forEach((file) => {
		const frontMatter = matter(fs.readFileSync(file).toString())

		recentPosts.push({
			title: frontMatter.data.title,
			description: frontMatter.data.description,
			originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
			keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
			url: `/${post.replace(".mdx", "")}`,
			category: frontMatter.data.category,
		})
	})

    return recentPosts
}
```

We use the `glob.sync` function to fetch all the files that match our glob pattern and save the result as an array of paths.
We then iterate over the array and use the same code we used before to parse the frontmatter and add the post to the array.
However, we will now have to make a small change to the `url` property, as we no longer have the file name, but the full path.
We can solve this using a little bit of string manipulation to get just the file name.

```ts
recentPosts.push({
	title: frontMatter.data.title,
	description: frontMatter.data.description,
	originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
	keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
    url: `/${file.split("/").slice(-1).join("").replace(".mdx", "")}`,
	category: frontMatter.data.category,
})
```

The inquisitive reader will notice, we aren't quite finished yet.
While we can now fetch all the posts we want, we now have to change the way posts are rendered.
We can alleviate some of the pain by adding another property to the `Post` interface, which will be the path to the file.

```ts
recentPosts.push({
	title: frontMatter.data.title,
	description: frontMatter.data.description,
	originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
	keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
    path: file,
    url: `/${file.split("/").slice(-1).join("").replace(".mdx", "")}`,
	category: frontMatter.data.category,
})
```

Now, we can modify our `getStaticProps` function on our post page to use the path to the file. 
Similar changes will be needed for all components which depend on the `fetchPosts` function, but I won't go into detail here.
Here's what the code for fetching a post page looks like.

<CodeTitle name="[post].tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<
    PostPageProps,
    PostPageParams
> = async ({ params }) => {
    const post = params!.post
    const posts = fetchPosts()

    // Filter out the post we want
    const file = fs
        .readFileSync(posts.find((p) => p.url.replace("/", "") === post)!.path)
        .toString()

    // Then pass the file to the mdx compiler
    ...
}
```

And that's it! We now have a much more flexible way of fetching posts, and we can now organize our posts however we want.
This opens up many new avenues to explore, one of which I have slowly been building behind the scenes. Hopefully, you will get to see it soon.

# A Month in Review

While this month was meant to be focused on our next project, the note-taking application, we spent a lot of time on the blog.
University has, as university does, taken up a lot of my time, and I haven't been able to work on the notes app as much as I would have liked.
Job hunting has also taken up a lot of my time, and I've been working on a few self-improvement projects.
Even though it wasn't the original plan, I'm still glad it worked out this way, as the blog is slowly becoming better and better.
Looking ahead to March, I hope to pick up the pace and get the notes app working.

Until then.
