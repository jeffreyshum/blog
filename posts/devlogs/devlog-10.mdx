While it has been a long time since we have worked on our note-taking app (I seemed to always get sidetracked),
progress has finally been made. I have decided to start from scratch as there were a few very challenging hurdles that I
could foresee in the future. This time, we will be working with Electron and React.
I have been wanting to learn Electron for a while now, and I think this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

# Electron

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is a framework that allows you to build desktop applications using web technologies.
It is based on Chromium (the engine that powers Google Chrome) and Node.js to allow you to build native apps much like you would a web app.
Many popular apps such as Discord, Spotify, and Visual Studio Code are built on top of Electron.
While Electron is often criticized for being slow and bloated (since it runs an instance of Chromium), it is still a very powerful tool.

# Getting Started 

While you can start a new Electron project from scratch, I decided to use the wonderful template [Electron Vite React](https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-react),
which provides a great starting point for Electron apps using Vite (an incredibly fast set of development tools) and React.
I will be using this template for the rest of this post, although almost all of the information here is not specific to any template.

To get started, we need to clone the template and install the dependencies, npm provides a command to easily copy the template:

```bash
npm create electron-vite

cd electron-vite-react

npm install
```

We can now run the app using `npm run dev`, which will start the app in development mode.

If you recall from previous posts, the core of any note-taking app is the ability to modify notes, and the ability to view them.
To help us with this, we will be using [react-simple-code-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-code-editor) for the editor,
and [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) for the preview.
I will also be using [styled-components] for styling, which is a very powerful CSS-in-JS library. 

```bash
npm install react-simple-code-editor react-markdown styled-components
```

# The Editor 

Luckily for us, the editor is very simple to implement with the help of react-simple-code-editor.
We can simply import the editor and pass in the appropriate props to get a fully functional editor.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, useState } from "react"
import Editor from "react-simple-code-editor";
import styled from "styled-components";

const AppContainer = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
`

const StyledEditor = styled(Editor)`
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
    resize: none;
    outline: none
    padding: 1rem;
`

const App: FC = () => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState("");

    return (
        <AppContainer>
            <StyledEditor
                value={value}
                onValueChange={setValue}
                highlight={code => code}
            />
        </AppContainer>
    )
}

export default App
```

If we want to add some syntax highlighting, we can use [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) to do so.
We simply pass in a highlight function that takes in the current text and returns the highlighted text.

```tsx
import { highlight, languages } from "prismjs"
import "prismjs/components/prism-markdown"

return (
    <AppContainer>
        <StyledEditor
            value={value}
            onValueChange={setValue}
            highlight={code => highlight(code, languages.markdown, "markdown")}
        />
    </AppContainer>
)
```

Now we need the ability to render the user input as markdown.
For now, I am using the same component described in this [devlog](/devlog-5) along with a few plugins
like [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math), [remark-gfm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-gfm),
[rehype-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex),
[rehype-prism-plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus),
and [rehype-prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism).

<CodeTitle name="Render.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC } from "react"
import styled from "styled-components"
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown"
import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus"
import rehypeKatex from "rehype-katex"
import remarkMath from "remark-math"
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm"

const StyledRender = styled.div`
	width: 100%;
	min-height: 100%;
	padding: 1rem;
`

interface RenderProps {
	content: string
}

const Render: FC<RenderProps> = ({ content }) => {
	return (
		<StyledRender>
			<ReactMarkdown
				rehypePlugins={[
					[rehypePrism, { ignoreMissing: true }],
					rehypeKatex,
				]}
				remarkPlugins={[remarkMath, remarkGfm]}>
				{content}
			</ReactMarkdown>
		</StyledRender>
	)
}

export default Render
```

Here's what it looks like:

# Next Steps

Now that we have a basic editor and preview, we can start working on working with files.
We need to be able to save (preferably automatically), open, and create new files. 
We also need a way to organize our files within our app.

Unfortunately, that will have to wait for next week.

Until then.
