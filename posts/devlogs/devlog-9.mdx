# A Case for Citations 

When you hear the word "citation" what do you think of?
Perhaps you recall the dreaded high school English class, where you were repeatedly told to "cite your sources" and "don't plagiarize".
Or maybe you think of that giant list of references at the end of a scientific paper (or more realistically a Wikipedia article).
If you're like me, you have probably wondered why citations are so important, and why they are sometimes so difficult to get right.

Naturally, the answer to this question is "they prevent plagiarism". Citations are a way to give credit to an original author(s) for their work, and to prevent others from assuming that the work is your own.
This is especially important in academics, where new ideas are built upon the work of others. 
However, citations are also important in other fields, such as journalism, where it is important to give credit to your sources to prevent the spread of misinformation.

While these are both good reasons to cite your sources, they are not entirely satisfying to someone who is not a professional writer.
After all, if you were a high school student writing a paper on the history of the American Revolution, it is unlikely that your paper would be taken seriously even if you did cite your sources.
As a matter of fact, in our modern age of quick information access, the value of citations is even more questionable.
Despite all of this, my argument for citations is not that they are important for sourcing your work, but rather that they are important for a reader who is interested in learning more about whatever you are writing.

As a writer, your primary goal is to communicate your ideas to your audience.
But as a writer, you have a secondary goal: to make your audience care about your ideas. 
Citations give a reader who cares to have immediate access to the source of your ideas, and thus allows them to learn more about the topic.
Of course, this is not to say that citations are the only way to do this, but just the fact that you can provide even just one reader with a path to more information is more than enough to justify the effort of citing your sources.

# Now to the Code

Now that we have established the importance of citations, let's talk about how I implemented them.
Blog posts like this one are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a JSX-enhanced form of Markdown.
The MDX compiler parses JSX tags in Markdown and convert them into their appropriate HTML or React components.
This means that we need to create a custom React component to render our citations.

But before we start implementing our `Citation` component, let's first talk about what we want it to do.
Of course, this involves deciding what type of citation we want to support.
Luckily for us, we can support all types of citation formats. 
We can do this by abstracting citations into a few key formatting components.

For example, let's take a look at the following citation written in the AMS format, popular in the mathematical sciences:

<br/>
<Citation
    type="AMS"
    firstName="Carl Friedrich"
    lastName="Gauss"
    title="Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"
    year="1965 (1801)"
    publisher="Yale University Press"
    publisherLocation="New Haven, CT"
/>

You will notice that this citation has a mix of regular and italic text, as well as a mix of commas and periods to separate the different parts of the citation.
This is a common pattern throughout all citation formats, and thus we can abstract this into a few components.
The use of [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or similar CSS-in-JS libraries makes this process much easier.
My implementation will use styled-components.

Let's start with components for text styling.

<CodeTitle name="Citation.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import styled from "styled-components"

// These styles are redundant but are included for the sake of exposition
const Italics = styled.em`
    font-style: italic;
`

const Bold = styled.strong`
    font-weight: bold;
`

// We don't need to make a component for normal text

```

Now that we have our text-styling components, let's move on to the components for punctuation.

<CodeTitle name="Citation.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
const CommaAfter = styled.span`
	&:after {
		content: ", ";
	}
`

const PeriodAfter = styled.span`
	&:after {
		content: ". ";
	}
`
```

Finally, let's create a component for the actual citation. I will also include a TypeScript interface, and a few extra components that will we will use.
<CodeTitle name="Citation.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC } from "react"

interface CitationProps {
	type?: "AMS"
	firstName?: string
	lastName?: string
	title: string
	volume?: number
	publisher?: string
	publisherLocation?: string
	year?: number
	doi?: string
	link?: string
}

const Container = styled.li`
	list-style: none;
`

const Link = styled.a`
	color: var(--text-color-article-link);
`

const Citation: FC<CitationProps> = (props) {
	switch (props.type) {
		case "AMS":
			return (
				<Container>
					<CommaAfter>
						{props.firstName} {props.lastName}
					</CommaAfter>
					<Italics>{props.title}</Italics>
					{props.volume && <CommaAfter>{props.volume}</CommaAfter>}
					{props.publisher && (
						<CommaAfter>{props.publisher}</CommaAfter>
					)}
					{props.publisherLocation && (
						<CommaAfter>{props.publisherLocation}</CommaAfter>
					)}
					{props.year && <PeriodAfter>{props.year}</PeriodAfter>}
					{props.doi && (
						<PeriodAfter>
							<Link
								href={`https://doi.org/${props.doi}`}
								target="_blank"
								rel="noreferrer"
							>
								doi:{props.doi}
							</Link>
						</PeriodAfter>
					)}
					{props.link && (
						<PeriodAfter>
							<Link
								href={props.link}
								target="_blank"
								rel="noreferrer"
							>
								{props.link}
							</Link>
						</PeriodAfter>
					)}
				</Container>
			)
		default:
			return <></>
    }
}

export default Citation
```

And that's it. To add more citation formats, we can just add more cases to the switch statement (and the interface).
Hopefully, you will see this component in action in the very new future.

Until then.
