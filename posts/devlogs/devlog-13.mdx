Nowadays, when you want to stay up to date with something on the internet, you subscribe or follow something.
It could subscribe to your favorite YouTube channel (don't forget to hit the bell icon!), follow your favorite podcast (wherever you get your podcasts),
or set up notifications for your favorite social media accounts.
In modern web browsers, you can even subscribe to web pages and receive notifications much like you would from a mobile app.

However, a relic of the past is still (barely) alive and well: RSS.

# RSS

RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a standardized way to send updates to a user, much like a notification.
As the name suggests, it's a really simple format to syndicate, which means to distribute a content.
It's been around since the early days of the internet and is still used by many websites and services, although the average user probably doesn't know it.

In essence, RSS is an XML file that contains a list of items, each of which represents a piece of content, or a feed.
A user can subscribe to an RSS feed, which means adding your website's RSS XML file URL to their RSS reader.
The RSS reader will then periodically check for updates to the RSS feed, and notify the user of any new items.
These items can be anything, from a new blog post to a new podcast episode to even a new tweet, it will all show up in the user's RSS reader.

# Adding RSS to The Blog 

To get started with RSS, we need to install the `rss` package, which provides us with a clean API to generate RSS feeds.

```bash
npm install rss

# or

yarn add rss
```

Now, we can create a new utility function to generate an RSS feed for our blog.

<Directory name="utils" expanded={true}>
    <Directory name="rss_feed.ts" language="typescript" />
</Directory>

<CodeTitle name="rss_feed.ts" language="typescript" />
```typescript
import RSS from "rss"

const generateFeed = async () => {
    // Create a new RSS feed with some options
    const feed = new RSS({
        title: "Jeffrey Shum's Blog",
        feed_url: "https://jeffreyshum.com/rss.xml",
        site_url: "https://jeffreyshum.com",
        language: "en",
    })
}

export default generateFeed
```

We defined the following function in [Devlog#8](/devlog-8), which fetches all of our blog posts and returns them as an array of `Post` objects.

<CodeTitle name="fetch_posts.ts" language="typescript" />
```typescript
import fs from "fs"
import matter from "gray-matter"
import { Post } from "../pages"
import glob from "glob"

const fetchPosts = () => {
	const recentPosts: Array<Post> = []

	const files = glob.sync("posts" + "/**/*.mdx")

	files.forEach((file) => {
		const frontMatter = matter(fs.readFileSync(file).toString())

		recentPosts.push({
			title: frontMatter.data.title,
			description: frontMatter.data.description,
			originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
			keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
			path: file,
			url: `/${file.split("/").slice(-1).join("").replace(".mdx", "")}`,
			category: frontMatter.data.category,
		})
	})

	// sort posts by date
	recentPosts.sort((a, b) => {
		const dateA = new Date(a.originalDate)
		const dateB = new Date(b.originalDate)

		if (dateA.getTime() > dateB.getTime()) return -1
		if (dateA.getTime() < dateB.getTime()) return 1
		return 0
	})

	return recentPosts
}

export default fetchPosts
```

We can use this function to pass in our blog posts to our RSS feed.

<CodeTitle name="rss_feed.ts" language="typescript" />
```typescript
import RSS from "rss"
import fetchPosts from "./fetch_posts"

const generateFeed = async () => {
    const feed = new RSS({
        title: "Jeffrey Shum's Blog",
        feed_url: "https://jeffreyshum.com/rss.xml",
        site_url: "https://jeffreyshum.com",
        language: "en",
    })

    const posts = fetchPosts()

    posts.forEach((post, i) => {
        if (i >= 20) return
        feed.item({
			title: post.title,
			description: post.description,
			url: url + post.url,
			date: post.originalDate,
			categories: [post.category],
		})
    })
}

export default generateFeed
```

Now, we can generate our XML file by calling `feed.xml()`, and using `fs` to write it to a file.

```typescript
fs.writeFileSync("./public/rss.xml", feed.xml({ indent: true }))
```

With that, we now have an RSS feed for our blog that generates every time we build our site.
But, we still need to run this function at some point to generate our RSS feed.
We can do this by running it when we build our `index.js` page through NextJS's `getStaticProps` function.

<CodeTitle name="index.tsx" language="react" />
```typescript
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
	await generateFeed()

	return {
		props: {
			recentPosts: fetchPosts().slice(0, 5),
		},
	}
}
```

And that's it! We now have an RSS feed for our blog.
If you want to subscribe to my RSS feed, you can do so [here](https://jeffreyshum.com/rss.xml), or through the link in the footer.

Next week, we'll return to our notes app. 

Until then.
