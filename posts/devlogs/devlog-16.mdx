This week is a continuation of [last week's devlog](/devlog-15), where we continue to improve the user experience of our note-taking app.
Last week, we worked on improving the fluidity of the app with quality-of-life improvements such as an unsaved changes warning and fixing continuity issues.
Now, let us turn to the visual aspect of the app and add persistent theming.

# Persisting Data

To aid in persisting our app's theme to the user's preferences, we will be using [Electron Store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-store), a library that allows us to easily store data in the user's system.

To get started, we will first install the library:
```bash
npm install electron-store

# or

yarn add electron-store
```

Next, from our main process, we will create our store's schema, which represents the data we want to be able to store.
Using that schema, we will create a new instance of the store.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts 
import Store, { Schema } from "electron-store"

type themes = "light" | "dark"

interface PersistentData {
    theme: themes
}

const Schema: Schema<PersistentData> = {
    theme: {
        type: "string"
        default: "dark"
    },
}

const store = new Store({ schema })
```

Now, when we start our app for the first time, Electron Store will create a new file in the user's system to store our data.
If that file already exists, it will load the data from that file.
Now, we need some way to update the data in the store.

In [Devlog #11](/devlog-11), we created the menus for our app. Let's add a menu item to toggle the theme of our app.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
{ type: "separator" },
{
    label: "Toggle Dark Theme",
    click: () => {
        store.set(
            "theme",
            store.get("theme") == "dark" ? "light" : "dark"
        )
    },
},
```

Now, when we click on the menu item, it will toggle the theme in the store.
However, we still need to update the theme of our app depending on the value in the store.

# Passing To The Renderer

To pass the theme to the renderer, let us use Electron's IPC system.
First, we will tap into Electron Store's `onDidChange` event to listen for changes to the theme and then send the new theme to the renderer.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts {1}
const store = new Store({ schema, watch: true})

store.onDidChange("theme", (newTheme, _) => {
	BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()?.webContents.send("theme-change", newTheme)
})
```

Next, we will listen for the `theme-change` event in the renderer and update the state accordingly.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
const App: FC = () => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState(new Store().get("theme", "dark") as string)

    useEffect(() => {
        ipcRenderer.on("theme-change", (_, newTheme) => {
            setTheme(newTheme)
        })
    }, [])
}
```

Now, we can use the `theme` state to update the theme of our app. 
This can be done in a variety of ways, but the easiest way is to use the power of styled-components.

# styled-components

[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is a CSS-in-JS library that allows us to write CSS in our JavaScript code.
It also allows us to use props to dynamically change the styles of our components.

Let's start by passing the `theme` state to our `App` component.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx 
import styled from "styled-components"

const StyledAppContainer = styled.div`
`
const App: FC = () => {
    return <StyledAppContainer theme={theme}>...</StyledAppContainer>
}
```

Now, we can check the value of the `theme` prop and change global CSS variables accordingly.
Here's an example of how we can change the background color and the text color of our app depending on the theme.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx 
const StyledAppContainer = styled.div`
    --bg-primary: ${(props) => props.theme === "dark" ? "#222222" : "#ffffff"};
    --text-color-primary: ${(props) => props.theme === "dark" ? "#f8f8ff" : "#000000"};
`
```

And that's it! We now have a fully working theme toggler.
While this appears to be a small change, it opens up a lot of possibilities for us to style our app.
Electron store also allows us the possibility of allowing a user to customize the specific colors of the app, which we may explore in the future.

For now, we will continue with just the light and dark themes and focus on some finishing touches for the app. But that will have to wait for next week.

Until then.
