As mentioned in previous posts, I have been a bit busy for the past few weeks with the end-of-semester crunch, leading to some shorter devlogs.
I hope that this will be the last of these shorter devlogs for a while.

Recall that in the last devlog, we started a basic Flask backend for our large-scale project.
This week, we will be focusing on error handling in Flask.

# Error Handling

The following code snippet represents one of the routes we created the mock-up for in the last devlog.
It is a simple route that returns a list of tasks for a given user, based on a `uuid` query parameter.
However, if the `uuid` parameter is not provided (and in the future if the `uuid` is not valid), we want to return some sort of error.
Here we return a 400 error, which is the standard error code for a bad request.

<CodeTitle name="tasks.py" language="python" />
```python {9-10}
from flask import request, abort, jsonify

task_routes = Blueprint("tasks", __name__)

@task_routes.route("/task-list")
def get_task_list():
    uuid = request.args.get("uuid")

    if not uuid:
        abort(400)
    
    return jsonify(uuid=uuid, tasks=tasks)
```

When we run this code, and try to access the route without the `uuid` parameter, we get the following:

![400 Error](./images/posts/devlog-19/bad_request.png)

While this error message is human-readable, it is not very code friendly.
We can always check the status code of the response from the front end (and we should), but it would be nice to have a more code-friendly error message.
To do this, we can use an error handler.

To start, we will create a new file called `errors.py` and set up a blueprint for all our error handlers.

<CodeTitle name="errors.py" language="python" />
```python
from flask import Blueprint

errors = Blueprint("errors", __name__)
```

We will also register this blueprint to our app.

<CodeTitle name="app.py" language="python" />
```python {5}
from flask import Flask
from errors import errors

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(errors)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, let's create an error handler that will catch the 400 error code across our entire app through `app_errorhandler`. 

<CodeTitle name="errors.py" language="python" />
```python {6-8}
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify

errors = Blueprint("errors", __name__)


@errors.app_errorhandler(400)
def bad_request(e):
    return jsonify(status=400, error="Malformed Request"), 400
```

Now, when we try to access the route without the `uuid` parameter, we get the following:

![400 Error](./images/posts/devlog-19/json_error.png)

This is much more code friendly, and we can easily parse this error message in the frontend.
We can create error handlers for all the other error codes as well, like 404, 500, etc.
We could have also made this error handler from our `tasks.py` file to catch only the 400 error codes from that file, this time using `errorhandler` instead of `app_errorhandler`.

<CodeTitle name="tasks.py" language="python" />
```python
@task_routes.errorhandler(400)
...

```

And that's the basics of error handling in Flask. As mentioned, I hope that next week will be more eventful.

Until then.
