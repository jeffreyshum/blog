If you recall from [Devlog#12](/devlog-12) we added the ability to save an open file for our note-taking app built with Electron and React.
The way we did this was by using the browser's native `localStorage` as a handoff between the main and renderer processes.
This worked well, but it was a bit of a hack, requiring us to forcefully execute JavaScript from the main process to the renderer process.
Despite this, it was a good way to get started, and due to `localStorage` being persistent, provided us with some nice quality-of-life features.

This week, we will turn to the suggested method for communicating between the main and renderer processes, which is to use Electron's IPC system.

# IPC

Electron's Inter-Process Communication is an event-based system that allows us to send and receive messages between the main and renderer processes.
There are two modules that we will be using for this, `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer`, each of which are used within the main and renderer processes respectively.

Let's start with implementing a way to open a file.
Recall that our open file functionality is implemented through Electron's menu system.
For example, we have the following menu item.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
{
    label: "Open",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+O",
    click: () => {},
}
```

Let's start with tapping into Electron's Dialog API to help us in opening a file.

```ts {5-16}
{
    label: "Open",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+O",
    click: () => {
        const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()

        const path = dialog.showOpenDialogSync(window, {
            title: "Save",
            defaultPath: app.getPath("documents"),
            filters: [
                {
                    name: "Markdown",
                    extensions: ["md", "markdown"],
                },
            ],
        })
    },
}
```

More information on how to create a dialog can be found [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/dialog), and in [Devlog#12](/devlog-12).
For the TypeScript users, you will notice that the `showOpenDialogSync` function returns a `string[] | undefined` type.
This is because the user can select multiple files at once, or cancel the dialog.

For our app, we will simply open the first file in the array, and do nothing if the user cancels the dialog.
Now that we have the path to the file we want to open, we should also make sure that our currently open file is saved.
Let's create a function to check for this and prompt a dialogue if necessary.

```ts
const saveBeforeAction = async () => {
	const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
	const saved = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('saved')"
	)
	const content = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('content')"
	)
	const path = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('path')"
	)
	if (saved == "false" && (content || path)) {
		const requestSave = dialog.showMessageBoxSync(
			BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow(),
			{
				type: "question",
				buttons: ["No", "Yes"],
				defaultId: 1,
				message:
					"Do you want to save the changes you made to the document?",
			}
		)
		if (requestSave == 1) {
			save()
		}
	}
}
```

Now we can call this function before we prompt to open a file.
Then, if we have a path, we will pass that path through IPC, for our React app to fetch and render from.

```ts {5,19-21}
{
    label: "Open",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+O",
    click: async () => {
        await saveBeforeAction()
        const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()

        const path = dialog.showOpenDialogSync(window, {
            title: "Save",
            defaultPath: app.getPath("documents"),
            filters: [
                {
                    name: "Markdown",
                    extensions: ["md", "markdown"],
                },
            ],
        })

        if (path) {
            window.webContents.send("open-file", path[0])
        }
    },
}
```

From our React side, we will listen for the `open-file` event, fetch the file provided, and set our state accordingly.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    ipcRenderer.on("open-file", (e, path) => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", path)
        setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
    })
}, [])
```

Now we can open files!

# Closing Files

Now that we can open files, we should also be able to close them.
This is a lot easier than opening files, as all we have to do is send an event to the renderer process to clear the state.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
{
    label: "New Window",
    accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+N",
    click: async () => {
        await saveBeforeAction()
        const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
        window.webContents.send("new-window")
    },
}
```

From our React side, we will simply clear all our state when we receive the `new-window` event.
<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {2-5}
useEffect(() => {
    ipcRenderer.on("new-window", () => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", "")
        setContent("")
    })

    ipcRenderer.on("open-file", (e, path) => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", path)
        setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
    })

}, [])
```

And that's it! We now can open and close files, and prompt the user to save their work if they have any unsaved changes.

Next week, we will take a look at how we can improve our user experience.

Until then.
