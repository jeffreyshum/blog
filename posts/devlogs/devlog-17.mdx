For the past two months, I have been working on and off on a markdown-flavored note-taking app powered by React and Electron.
The progress for that project has been unfortunately slow but has been rather extensively documented in previous devlogs.
While the app is fully working and ready to be used in its current state, there are still a few features and finishing touches that I would like to add at some point.
However this week, with the start of a new month, I have decided to start a new project, and this time, I hope to have it completed quicker than the previous one.

For our new project, we will turn to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which provides a framework for building native mobile apps using React.
While front-end technologies have come a long way in the past few years, with the advent of progressive web apps and API additions to browsers, there are still many advantages to a native app.
While both native apps and web apps can be installed on a device, native apps are much more discoverable as they can be found on your favorite (or only) app store.
On the other hand, progressive web apps must be installed from the browser, directly from the website you want.
This means you must know about the website beforehand, that the website has a PWA, and that you care enough to install it anyways (you're already on the website, why would you need to install it?).

Native apps have other advantages as well, such as being able to access more of the device's hardware and software.
For example, readers with the latest iPhone may have noticed apps taking advantage of the dynamic island portion of the screen.
Native apps also provide increased security, but that is not our primary concern for this project (but it should always be!).

# The App 

The app we will be building is perhaps a continuation of the previous project but with a different focus.
Our app will certainly be able to take notes, but it will also be able to do much more.
The goal of this app is to be an encompassing suite of productivity tools, including note-taking and task management.

Let's spend the rest of this devlog outlining the features we want to include in this app.

# Calendar Integrations

What's the point of a productivity app if it doesn't help you manage your time?

Of course, as [Tom Scott bluntly puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&ab_channel=Computerphile), we should most certainly avoid rebuilding the wheel here.
There are already many great calendar apps out there, and we should not try to compete with them.
Instead, we should try to integrate our app with them.

The most obvious integration would be with Google Calendar, which is arguably the most popular calendar app.
But of course, we should also try to integrate with other popular calendar apps, such as Outlook and Yahoo.
Our app should be able to read and write (with permission) to the user's calendar and be able to display events from the calendar.

# Task Management 

In a similar vein, our app should be able to maintain a list of tasks for the user.
This list should try to integrate with the user's calendar (and vice versa), for a completely streamlined experience.

For example, if the user has a task due on a certain day, the app should be able to create an event on the user's calendar for that day. 

# Note-Taking 

This one is rather self-explanatory. Our app should provide the user with a way to take notes, and organize them in a way that makes sense to them.
This does not need to be as extensive as our previous project, but it should be able to handle the basic features that a user might expect from a note-taking app.

# User Sync

All of the above features are great, but they are only useful if the user can access them from anywhere and everywhere.
This means that our app should be able to sync all the user's data across all their devices.
From a technical perspective, there will need to be great care put into the backend with how we store this data.
We will also need to consider how we attribute data to a user, and how we authenticate them.
We can perhaps integrate with popular authentication providers, such as Google.

# Why Not Just Use Google?

While we are on the topic of Google, you may be wondering why we don't just use Google's existing suite of productivity tools.
The list is rather extensive, and includes Google Calendar, Google Keep, Google Tasks, and Google Drive, all of which sync with your Gmail account!
While Google does provide an amazing suite of tools, and this project is certainly inspired by them (and others), there are a few reasons why I want to build my own.

Firstly, the primary goal of this project will be user customization. Google is notorious for changing its UI and not providing users with a way to revert to the old UI.
While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can be frustrating for users who have grown accustomed to the old UI.
This project will allow users to fully customize the UI to their liking through the positioning of widgets (hopefully).

Secondly, I want to build this project to learn more about React Native and mobile development in general.
Phones are not going anywhere anytime soon, and I think it is important to be able to build apps for them, especially if tools like React Native exists to make it easier.

And finally, I want to build this project to spend more time on the backend portion of an app.
Most of the features named above will require a backend, and I want to learn to build a backend that can adapt to these needs effectively.

Next week, we will start building the app, starting with just that, the backend.

Until then.
