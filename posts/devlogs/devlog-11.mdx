This week's devlog is a less technical content than usual, but I believe that it may be one of the most important for our notes-taking app project.
Last week, we started on a fresh slate with Electron for building native desktop apps, while also getting a rudimentary, but fully working, editor and renderer set up.

Now, let us turn our attention to menus. Not the menu that you might get in a restaurant, but the menu that you might see in a desktop app.
It is the list of options that you can select to perform an action, typically at the top of an application.
If you are a Mac user, you will be very familiar with this concept, as Mac apps all have a menu bar at the top of the screen.
But app menus are not exclusive to Macs and are ubiquitous across all platforms.

For example, open up your favorite text editor and might find a menu with a "File" option, which has a "New" option, a "Save" option, and a "Quit" option.
Next to that, you might have an "Edit" menu, which has a "Copy" option, a "Paste" option, a "Select All" option, and so on.
These menus are not just for show, but they are also a way for users to interact with your app.
While many people now commonly use keyboard shortcuts to perform actions, like Ctrl+C to copy, Ctrl+V to paste, and Ctrl+A to select all, menus are still very important for accessibility and discoverability.

Consider the case of a user who is using a note-taking application for the first time (like our app).
They might not know how to create a new note, or how to save their work.
They might even find the app overwhelming at first, and not know where to start.
In this case, the menu bar provides an important grounding point for the user to start exploring the app.
If they want to open a file with our app, their first instinct might be to look at the "File" menu, and they will find the "Open" option there.
Or maybe, they want to change the font size of their note, and they will find an "Edit" menu with a "Font Size" option.
And if none of these options are what they are looking for, they can always look at the "Help" menu, which will attempt to guide them to the right place.

So clearly menus are important, but how do we implement them in Electron?

# Electron Menus 

Electron provides a very simple API for creating menus and even provides a lot of built-in functionality for us.

To start, we need to create a menu template, which is simply an array of objects that describe the menu items.
Each item in this array contains a `label` property, which is the text that will be displayed as the menu button, and an array called `submenu` that contains the items that will be displayed when the user clicks on the menu button.

For example, here is a simple menu template for an "Edit" menu that has a "Copy" option, a "Paste" option, and a "Select All" option:

```ts 
const template = [
    {
        label: "Edit",
        submenu: [
            { role: "copy" },
            { role: "paste" },
            { role: "selectAll" },
        ],
    },
]

```

Notice here that we are using the `role` property. This is a special property that Electron provides for us, which allows us to tap into some of the built-in functions.
For example, the `copy` role will automatically copy the selected text to the clipboard, and the `paste` role will automatically paste the contents of the clipboard into the app.
Why reinvent the wheel?

But what if we want to add some custom functionality to a menu item?
For example, what if we want to add a "Save" option to our "File" menu?
We can create a custom menu item by using the `label` property and a `click` property to describe behavior.

```ts
const template = [
    {
        label: "File",
        submenu: [
            {
                label: "Save",
                click: () => {
                    // Save the file
                },
            },
        ],
    },
]

```

Our newly created "Save" menu item should also adhere to the standard keyboard shortcut for saving, which is Ctrl+S (Cmd+S for Mac users). 
We can add this shortcut by using the `accelerator` property.

```ts
const template = [
    {
        label: "File",
        submenu: [
            {
                label: "Save",
                accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+S",
                click: () => {
                    // Save the file
                },
            },
        ],
    },
]

```

Now, let's create a basic set of menus for our note-taking app.
These menus will provide us with a clear set of goals for our app and will help us to understand what features we need to implement.
Since our app uses TypeScript, we will do some type coerhsions to make our code compliable, as suggested by [jkmartindale on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68232071).

```ts
import { MenuItemConstructorOptions } from "electron"

const template: MenuItemConstructorOptions[] = [
	...((process.platform === "darwin"
		? [
				{
					label: app.name,
					submenu: [
						{ role: "about" },
						{ type: "separator" },
						{ role: "services" },
						{ type: "separator" },
						{ role: "hide" },
						{ role: "hideOthers" },
						{ role: "unhide" },
						{ type: "separator" },
						{ role: "quit" },
					],
				},
		  ]
		: []) as MenuItemConstructorOptions[]),
	{
		label: "File",
		submenu: [
			{
				label: "New Window",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+N",
				click: () => {},
			},
			{
				label: "Open",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+O",
				click: () => {},
			},
			{ type: "separator" },
			{
				label: "Save",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+S",
				click: () => {},
			},
			{
				label: "Save As",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+Shift+S",
				click: () => {},
			},
			{ type: "separator" },
			{
				label: "Close",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+W",
				click: () => {},
			},
		],
	},
	{
		label: "Edit",
		submenu: [
			{ role: "undo" },
			{ role: "redo" },
			{ type: "separator" },
			{ role: "cut" },
			{ role: "copy" },
			{ role: "paste" },
			{ type: "separator" },
			{
				label: "Find",
				accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+F",
				click: () => {},
			},
			{
				label: "Replace",
				click: () => {},
			},
		],
	},
	{
		label: "Selection",
		submenu: [
			{
				role: "selectAll",
			},
		],
	},
]
```

Notice that we have a conditional menu that is only displayed for Mac users.
This is because MacOS has a special menu called the "Application" menu that is always displayed as the first menu item, next to the Apple logo.

Now that we have our menu template, we need to bind it to our app.
We can do this by calling the `Menu.setApplicationMenu` function and passing in our menu template, which we can create using the `Menu.buildFromTemplate` function.

```ts
import { Menu } from "electron"

Menu.setApplicationMenu(Menu.buildFromTemplate(template))
```

And that's it! We now have a fully functional menu bar for our app.
Next week, we will take a stab at implementing the functionalities for some of these menu items.

Until then.
