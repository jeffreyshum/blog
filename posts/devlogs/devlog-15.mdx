For the past month, we have slowly worked on a note-taking app built with React and Electron.
While the app is technically fully usable and functional, the user experience is still quite a bit lacking (and some menu items are still missing).
This week, we focused on making the app feel more polished and smooth, starting with a smooth user experience.
This devlog will be an amalgamation of these changes, many of which are small and subtle, but all of which add up to a much better user experience.

Let's get straight into it.

# Closing With Unsaved Changes 

Often, in text editor apps, when you close the app with unsaved changes, you are prompted with a dialog asking if you want to save your changes before exiting.
This is particularly important, as it is easy to accidentally close the app without saving your changes.

Recall from [Devlog#12](/devlog-12) that we determine whether we have something unsaved through a state stored in `localStorage`, which gets updated whenever the user makes a change to the note.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {3}
useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem("content", content)
    localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
}, [content])
```

This state is then updated again when the user saves their changes.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts {14-16}
const save = async () => {
	const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
	const path = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('path')"
	)

	if (path) {
		fs.writeFileSync(
			path,
			await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
				"localStorage.getItem('content')"
			)
		)
		await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
			"localStorage.setItem('saved', 'true')"
		)
	} else {
		saveAs()
	}
}
```

We can take advantage of this state to determine whether we have unsaved changes when the user tries to close the app.
First, we need to intercept the `close` event on the `BrowserWindow`, which is fired when the user tries to close the editor.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts {14-16}
async function createWindow() {
    win = new BrowserWindow({
		title: "Main window",
		icon: join(process.env.PUBLIC, "favicon.ico"),
		webPreferences: {
			preload,
			nodeIntegration: true,
			contextIsolation: false,
		},
	})

    ...

    win.on("close", async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
    })
}
```

Now, we need to prompt the user with a dialog asking if they want to save their changes, only if they have unsaved changes.
Conveniently, we already implemented this in [Devlog#14](/devlog-14), with opening a new file.
Recall that we have the following method:

```ts
const saveBeforeAction = async () => {
	const window = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()
	const saved = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('saved')"
	)
	const content = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('content')"
	)
	const path = await window.webContents.executeJavaScript(
		"localStorage.getItem('path')"
	)
	if (saved == "false" && (content || path)) {
		const requestSave = dialog.showMessageBoxSync(
			BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow(),
			{
				type: "question",
				buttons: ["No", "Yes"],
				defaultId: 1,
				message:
					"Do you want to save the changes you made to the document?",
			}
		)
		if (requestSave == 1) {
			await save()
		}
	}
}
```

We can use this method to prompt the user with a dialog asking if they want to save their changes before closing the app.
Afterward, we simply close the app as normal.

<CodeTitle name="main/index.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts {3-5}
win.on("close", async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    await saveBeforeAction()
    win.destroy()
    app.quit()
})
```

Now, when the user tries to close the app with unsaved changes, they will be prompted with a dialog asking if they want to save their changes before closing the app.

# Delayed State Updates

In the previous devlog, we implemented opening existing files using Electron's IPC system. Here is the code for that from the React end.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    ipcRenderer.on("new-window", () => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", "")
        setContent("")
    })

    ipcRenderer.on("open-file", (e, path) => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", path)
        setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
    })

}, [])
```

For the astute, you may notice that there is a small problem with this code in conjunction with the following `useEffect`, which also includes code for a title update:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")
    window.localStorage.setItem("content", content)
    window.localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
    document.title = "Cement - " + (path?.split("/").pop() || "Untitled")
}, [content])
```

The problem lies in the order of execution of these two `useEffect` hooks when we open a file.
When we provide a path during the `open-file` event, we send that path to our renderer process, which then sets the `content` state to the contents of the file.
This means, that when we open a file, the `content` state is updated lastly, which causes the `saved` state to be set to `false`, even though the file has not been modified yet.

We can fix this by keeping track of the previous `content` state, and only updating the `saved` state if the current `content` state differs from the previous.
Let's also do some error checking to make sure that the file exists before we try to read it, and have some fallback if it doesn't.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {1,6-9,18, 21-24}
const [previousContent, setPreviousContent] = useState("")

useEffect(() => {
    const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")
    window.localStorage.setItem("content", content)
    if (content !== previousContent) {
        window.localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
    }
    setPreviousContent(content)
    document.title = "Cement - " + (path?.split("/").pop() || "Untitled")
}, [content])

useEffect(() => {
    const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")
    if (path) {
        try {
            const fileData = fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8")
            setPreviousContent(fileData)
            setContent(fileData)
            window.localStorage.setItem("saved", "true")
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e)
            window.localStorage.setItem("path", "")
        }
    }

    ipcRenderer.on("new-window", () => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", "")
        setContent("")
    })

    ipcRenderer.on("open-file", (e, path) => {
        window.localStorage.setItem("path", path)
        setContent(fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8"))
        window.localStorage.setItem("saved", "true")
    })
}, [])
```

# Unsaved Changes Indication

Now that our `saved` state is working properly, we can use it to indicate to the user that they have unsaved changes.
We can do this by adding a `*` to the end of the title if the `saved` state is `false`.

<CodeTitle name="App.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx {5,8-10}
useEffect(() => {
    const path = window.localStorage.getItem("path")
    window.localStorage.setItem("content", content)

    const title = "Cement - " + path?.split("/").pop() || "Untitled"
    if (content !== previousContent) {
        window.localStorage.setItem("saved", "false")
        document.title = title + " *"
    } else {
        document.title = title
    }
    setPreviousContent(content)
}, [content])
```

And that's it for this week.

Next week, we will turn to the other half of the user experience, the looks.

Until then.
