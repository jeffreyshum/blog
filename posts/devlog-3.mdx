# Direct your Attention

In the modern digital age, we have a lot of files.
And with files, comes file systems, or ways to organize, manage, and access files.
You probably interact with a file system multiple times a day.
Perhaps you download a cute cat picture from the internet, or maybe you save an important document to your computer, or even just open your email, you're interacting with a file system.
The most common file system is the one on your computer, but there are many others, such as a database or a cloud storage service. 
Even a file cabinet is a file system!

If you're a developer, you're quite familiar with directories, or folders, as they represent the structure of a project.
In previous devlogs, we have developed ways to represent files and their contents for this blog, but we haven't yet developed a way to represent the structure of a project.
This week, we will add a **Directory** component to solve this problem.

Let's start by defining what our component has to do.
Since we're representing a folder, we need to be able to distinguish between two different folders, so we need a name.
We also need to be able to store files and other directories, as the children of a directory.
Finally, for the use case of this blog and exposition, we need a couple of optional customizations, such as a custom icon and whether or not the directory is expanded by default.

With this in mind, we can define the following TypeScript interface.

<CodeTitle name="Directory.tsx" language="react" />

```tsx
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react"

interface DirectoryProps extends PropsWithChildren {
  name: string
  icon?: string
  expanded?: boolean
}
```

Notice here that we are inheriting from React's **PropsWithChildren** type, allowing our component to accept children.
This implementation allows for children of any type.
You can optionally specify a type for children if you want to restrict the types of children that your **Directory** component can take in.

Now that we have defined our interface, we can implement our component. Let's start with basic rendering.
Here, I have given elements classes for increased readability. 

<CodeTitle name="Directory.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./Directory.module.css"

const Directory: FC<DirectoryProps> = (props) => {
  // Note that we specified expanded to be an optional prop
  // By default, expanded will be false
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(props.expanded)

  return (
    <div className={styles.directory}>
      <div className={styles.label}>
        <img
          className={styles.icon}
          // If the icon prop is not specified, use the default icon
          src={props.icon ? props.icon : "/images/directory.svg"}
        />
        <p className={styles.name}>{props.name}</p>
      </div>
    
      { // We should only render children if there are any
        props.children && (
        <div className={styles.children}>
          {props.children}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Directory
```

Now that we have a basic implementation, let's add some interactivity.
Notice that we have an **expanded** state variable, which we can use to determine whether or not to render the children of the directory.
We will toggle this state variable when the user clicks on the label.
When the **expanded** state is true, we will append a CSS class to our children container to make it visible.
We will also add a class to the label to indicate when a directory is expandable.
To aid in this, we will use the popular [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) package.

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="Directory.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
<div className={styles.directory}>
  <div className={classNames(
    styles.label,
    props.children && styles.parent
    )}
    onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}
  >
    <img
      className={styles.icon}
      src={props.icon ? props.icon : "/images/directory.svg"}
    />
    <p className={styles.name}>{props.name}</p>
  </div>
  {props.children && (
    <div className={classNames(
      styles.children,
      expanded ? styles.active : styles.inactive
    )}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```
<CodeTitle name="Directory.module.css" language="css" />
```css
.parent:before {
    content: '>';
    transition: 0.35s;
}

/* Notice that we are using the adjacent sibling selector 
within a has psuedo-class. This allows us to only rotate the arrow 
for parents that have their direct children expanded (active). 
*/
.parent:has(+ .active):before {
    rotate: 90deg;
}

.inactive {
    display: none;
}

.active {
    display: block;
}
```
</TabbedView>

Another popular way to implement the expandable indicator is to conditionally render an SVG and rotate it accordingly.
There are also alternatives to the **classnames** package, like using JavaScript's template literals,
but I find the **classnames** package to be the most readable, while not significantly adding to the bundle size (only 18.8kB unpacked).

Here is all the code (along with my full CSS) in one place for convenience, and the final result when written up in MDX for a blog post like this one.

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="Directory.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./Directory.module.css"
import classNames from "classnames"

interface DirectoryProps extends PropsWithChildren {
  name: string
  icon?: string
  expanded?: boolean
}

const Directory: FC<DirectoryProps> = (props) => {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(props.expanded)

  return (
    <div className={styles.directory}>
      <div className={classNames(
        styles.label,
        props.children && styles.parent
        )}
        onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}
      >
        <img
          className={styles.icon}
          src={props.icon ? props.icon : "/images/directory.svg"}
          alt=""
        />
        <p className={styles.name}>{props.name}</p>
      </div>
      {props.children && (
        <div className={classNames(
          styles.children,
          expanded ? styles.active : styles.inactive
        )}>
          {props.children}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Directory
```
<CodeTitle name="Directory.module.css" language="css" />
```css
.directory {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-end;
    background-color: var(--bg-code);
    padding-top: 1rem;
    padding-left: 0.5rem;
    padding-bottom: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;
    box-shadow: var(--box-shadow);
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background-color var(--theme-change-transition);
}

.icon {
    height: 1.75rem;
    margin-right: 5px;
}

.label {
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    cursor: pointer;
    user-select: none;
}

.name {
    overflow-x: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}

.children {
    width: 95%;
    border-left: 2px dotted var(--text-color-primary);
}

.children > * {
    padding-top: 0;
    padding-bottom: 0;
    box-shadow: none;
    border-radius: 0;
}

.parent:before {
    content: '>';
    transition: var(--theme-change-transition);
}

.parent:has(+ .active):before {
    rotate: 90deg;
}

.inactive {
    display: none;
}

.active {
    display: block;

# More Loose Ends

You may have noticed that in **example.mdx**, the two files **Directory.tsx** and **Directory.module.css** are actually directories.
While I do not think this is intrinsically bad, I do think in large directories it can be a bit confusing to the writer (me).
However, in its current state, there is no need to have two separate components to accomplish one task.
I may change this in the future, but for now, I am happy with the result.

If you have been keeping up with my devlogs, you may notice that we now have all the components we need to completely replicate the look of an IDE.
The only thing left is to add the functionality to open and close files from a directory.
However, I am going to save that as an exercise for the future, as I do not feel that it is completely necessary given a tab system.

Next week, I would like to start a new project that will hopefully streamline the writing process.

Until then.
