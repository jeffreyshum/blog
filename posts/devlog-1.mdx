# Why a Blog?

In the modern age, information races in and out of our heads at an alarming rate.
In recent years, the trend towards short-form content has unquestionably taken over the internet.
Perhaps you have found yourself quickly tapping through your Instagram story feed only to quickly swipe back because something caught your eye.
Or maybe you're like me and you're swiping through TikToks or Youtube Shorts to find something you want to watch only to instinctively swipe away right as it gets good
(of course, swippng back and watching it from the beginning again).
Blogs seem to have lost their place on the internet, at least for the average person.

Yet a blog, coupled with modern web development (love it or hate it), can create an unparalleled method of demonstrating information.
Think of blogs as the middle ground between a book, where content is static and referencable, and a video, where content is visual and often more engaging.
With React (and other modern web frameworks), creating interactive and modular components is made easy.
MDX, an extended format of Markdown, makes it easy to write content while still being able to use our React components.
Josh W. Comeau goes into more detail about the power of MDX in his blog post, [How I Built my Blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/).
Couple these technologies with NextJS and its server-side rendering, and you have a powerful stack for creating a blog that stands out from the rest.
The rest of this post will go into detail on the core code that takes an MDX file and renders it into a blog post.

# mdx-bundler

The library that makes this all possible is [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler), built by the famous Kent C. Dodds.
mdx-bundler provides an asynchronous function that takes in an MDX string and returns a renderable React component.

```ts
import { useMemo } from "react"
import { getMDXComponent } from "mdx-bundler/client"

// Example from mdx-bundler README
// code is an MDX string, which we pass as a prop to our page
// Component is the React component that we render on our page
const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])
```

Since we are passing in an MDX string, we need a way to get said MDX string from an MDX file.
Luckily for us, mdx-bundler provides a sister function that takes in a source and returns its associated MDX string.
We will use this function in our page's associated getStaticProps function (more on this later).

```ts
import { bundleMDX } from "mdx-bundler"
import fs from "fs"

// we can also pass the file itself to bundleMDX,
// but we will use a raw string for now
const file = fs.readFileSync(fileName).toString()

// code is what is passed to our page
// frontmatter is metadata about the MDX file, which we will define later
const { code, frontmatter } = await bundleMDX({
	source: file,
})
```

# Building the Page

Now that we have a way to get a renderable component from an MDX file, we need a place to render it.
Since each post is itself a unique page, we will use NextJS's [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
Dynamic routes allow us to create a page for each post, and we can use the file name as the URL route.

But first, let's create some useful interfaces for TypeScript to work its magic.

```ts
export interface FrontMatter {
	title: string
	author: string
	description: string
	originalDate: string
	keywords: string
	editDate?: string
	category: string
}

export interface PostPageProps {
	code: string
	frontmatter: Frontmatter
}

export interface PostPageParams extends ParsedUrlQuery {}
```

Now that our interfaces have been declared, the purpose of frontmatter is much more apparent.
Frontmatter is a way to easily store and retrieve metadata about a post, such as a title, author, and description.
In our MDX, we can put the following at the top of every file:

```md

originalDate: "2023-01-03EST"

```

Now, recall that we destructured two properties from the return value of bundleMDX, **code** and **frontmatter**.
mdx-bundler will parse the frontmatter we declare in our files and return it as a JavaScript object.
Let's give those types as well.

```ts
const { code, frontmatter }: { code: string; frontmatter: FrontMatter } =
	await bundleMDX({ source: file })
```

Now that we have our code and frontmatter, we can pass them as props to our page.
To do this for a statically generated page in NextJS, we will have to define two functions: **getStaticPaths** and **getStaticProps**.

```ts
import fs from "fs"
import { GetStaticPaths, GetStaticProps } from "next"

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<
	PostPageProps,
	PostPageParams
> = async ({ params }) => {
	const { post } = params!

	// fetch the associated mdx file
	const fileName = `posts/${post}.mdx`
	const file = fs.readFileSync(fileName).toString()

	// bundleMDX
	const { code, frontmatter }: { code: string; frontmatter: FrontMatter } =
		await bundleMDX({ source: file })

	// pass it to our page
	return {
		props: {
			code,
			frontmatter,
		},
	}
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
	// get all files in our posts directory
	const posts = fs.readdirSync("posts")

	// create a path for each file
	return {
		paths: posts.map((post) => ({
			params: { post: post.replace(".mdx", "") },
		})),
		fallback: false,
	}
}
```

Now that we have our paths and props, we can create our page.

```tsx
import { NextPage } from "next"
import { useMemo } from "react"
import { getMDXComponent } from "mdx-bundler/client"
import Head from "next/head"

const PostPage: NextPage<PostPageProps> = ({ code, frontmatter }) => {
	const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])

	return (
		<>
			<Head>
				<title>{frontmatter.title}</title>
				<meta name="description" content={frontmatter.description} />
				<meta name="keywords" content={frontmatter.keywords} />
				<meta name="author" content={frontmatter.author} />
				<meta name="og:title" content={frontmatter.title} />
				<meta name="og:description" content={frontmatter.description} />
				<meta name="og:type" content="article" />
			</Head>
			<article>
				<div>
					<h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
					<p>{frontmatter.description}</p>
					<time
						dateTime={
							frontmatter.editDate || frontmatter.originalDate
						}
					>
						Updated:{" "}
						{new Date(
							frontmatter.editDate || frontmatter.originalDate
						).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
							year: "numeric",
							month: "short",
							day: "numeric",
						})}
					</time>
				</div>
				<hr />
				<Component />
			</article>
		</>
	)
}

export default PostPage
```

# Plugins

Now that we have a way to render MDX files as pages, we can add plugins to make our lives easier.
For example, to format code blocks, we can use [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus).
We can then provide **rehypePrism** as a plugin to mdx-bundler by providing an **mdxOptions** function as a parameter in our object.

```ts
const { code, frontmatter }: { code: string; frontmatter: FrontMatter } =
	await bundleMDX({
		source: file,
		mdxOptions(options) {
			options.rehypePlugins = [
				// ensure that any existing plugins are included
				...(options.rehypePlugins ?? []),
				// append all our plugins here
				rehypePrism,
			]
			return options
		},
	})
```

We can include any rehype or remark plugins in this way.
For example, this site currently also uses [rehype-katex](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main)
for rendering math expressions like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, and
[remarkMath](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main) for parsing math in MDX.
Note that plugins may require additional stylesheets to be included in your project.

# In the Next Episode

Until then. Happy New Year!
