# Creating an All Posts Route

Last week, we built the core system for rendering a post, but we are still missing something important.
A key feature of any blog is the ability to view all posts.
Luckily for us, this is rather easy to implement.

First, we have to find all the available posts.
Posts for this blog are housed in a **posts** directory.
We can use the **fs** module to read the contents of this directory.
Then, all we have to do is generate an array of post objects and sort them.

{<CodeTitle name="fetch_posts.ts" language="typescript" />}

```ts
import fs from "fs"
import matter from "gray-matter"

export interface Post {
	title: string
	description: string
	originalDate: string
	keywords: string
	url: string
	category: string
}

const fetchPosts = () => {
	const recentPosts: Array<Post> = []
	const posts = fs.readdirSync("posts")

	posts.forEach((post) => {
		const frontMatter = matter(fs.readFileSync(`posts/${post}`).toString())

		recentPosts.push({
			title: frontMatter.data.title,
			description: frontMatter.data.description,
			originalDate: frontMatter.data.originalDate,
			keywords: frontMatter.data.keywords,
			url: `/${post.replace(".mdx", "")}`,
			category: frontMatter.data.category,
		})
	})

	// sort posts by date
	recentPosts.sort((a, b) => {
		const dateA = new Date(a.originalDate)
		const dateB = new Date(b.originalDate)

		if (dateA.getTime() > dateB.getTime()) return -1
		if (dateA.getTime() < dateB.getTime()) return 1
		return 0
	})

	return recentPosts
}

export default fetchPosts
```

Notice here that we can leverage JavaScript's [built-in sort method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) for arrays to sort our posts.
To tell JavaScript to sort our posts by date, we have to convert the date strings into JavaScript Date objects.
Then, we can compare the dates and tell JavaScript to sort accordingly.

Now that we have a way to fetch all posts, we can create a page to list them.
For example, we may want to have a list of recently published posts on our home page.
It might look something like this.

{<CodeTitle name="index.tsx" language="react" />}

```tsx
import { GetStaticProps, NextPage } from "next"

const Index: NextPage<{ recentPosts: Array<Post> }> = ({ recentPosts }) => {
	return (
		<>
			{recentPosts.map((post, i) => (
				// Map each post object to some component
				<PostCard key={i} {...post} />
			))}
		</>
	)
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
	return {
		props: {
			recentPosts: fetchPosts().slice(0, 4),
		},
	}
}

export default Index
```

If we wanted to create a page that lists all posts, we would just have to remove the slice method.

```ts
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
	return {
		props: {
			recentPosts: fetchPosts(),
		},
	}
}
```

# Creating Embeddable Components

You may have noticed a new component in the code snippets above, the IDE-like code title.
This is just one of many components that can bring life to an otherwise boring page of text.
As mentioned last week, blog posts like this one are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a JSX-enhanced version of Markdown.

For example, we can write something like the following in our MDX files.

{<CodeTitle name="post.mdx" language="mdx" />}

````md
{<CodeTitle name="index.js" language="javascript" />}

```js
function hello() {
	console.log("Hello World")
}
```
````

And it will render like so.

{<CodeTitle name="index.js" language="javascript" />}

```js
function hello() {
	console.log("Hello World")
}
```

The key here is that we can use any React component we want in our MDX files, as long as we provide said component.
[mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) provides an easy way to pass in components.
We simply pass in an object containing all of the components we want to be available in our MDX files.

{<CodeTitle name="post.tsx" language="react" />}

```tsx
import Components from "/Components"

const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])

return (
	<>
		<Component components={Components} />
	</>
)
```

We can also replace the default HTML components using this prop. More on this can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler#component-substitution) for mdx-bundler.

# Let's get \<meta\>

This week, we also added important meta tags from the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) developed by Meta (formerly FaceBook).
Open Graph (OG) tags are similar to your standard meta tags, but they are specifically designed for social media embeds.
These tags are essential for any blog, as they allow you to customize the look of your posts when they are shared on platforms like Discord and Twitter.

To add these tags, we simply have to add them to our HTML head element as meta tags.
For a NextJS application, this is often done through the [next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) element.

For example, we can add the following tags to our post page to correspond with the post's title and description.

{<CodeTitle name="[post].tsx" language="react" />}

```tsx
return (
	<Head>
		<title>{frontmatter.title}</title>
		<meta name="description" content={frontmatter.description} />
		<meta name="keywords" content={frontmatter.keywords} />
		<meta name="author" content={frontmatter.author} />
		<meta name="og:title" content={frontmatter.title} />
		<meta name="og:description" content={frontmatter.description} />
		<meta name="og:type" content="article" />
		<meta name="og:type" content="article" />
		<meta name="og:article:author" content={frontmatter.author} />
		<meta
			name="og:article:published_time"
			content={frontmatter.originalDate}
		/>
		{frontmatter.editDate && (
			<meta
				name="og:article:modified_time"
				content={frontmatter.editDate}
			/>
		)}
		<meta name="og:article:tag" content={frontmatter.category} />
	</Head>
)
```

If we want to add an image to this embed, we can add the following tags:

```tsx
<meta
	name="og:image"
	content={`/images/splash/${frontmatter.splash}`}
>
<meta name="og:image:size" content="1200x630" />
```

Note that Twitter and Discord also use the following tag to describe the embed type.
You can read more about this tag from [Twitter's documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards).

```tsx
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
```

# Looking Ahead

This week, we also added a mobile-friendly navigation bar, and a dark mode toggle.
However, I am not fully satisfied with them in their current iteration, and will be revisited in the future.
Looking ahead, I plan to tackle post searching and pagination, along with taking a dabble at implementing an editor for easily working with our custom components.

Until then.
