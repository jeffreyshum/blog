An important part of any modern web application is user authentication.
For most applications, this is fairly straightforward, you press a green button and you're redirected to a login page, where you can sign in or create an account.
However, you may have noticed in the past five or so years, there's been a new trend of "social logins" where you can sign in with a Google, Facebook, or Twitter account.
The idea is that you don't have to remember another set of usernames and passwords for each website you use, and rather just log in with your existing accounts.
For the developer, offloading authentication and credential management to a third-party is a huge win, as it means you don't have to worry about storing passwords.
However, it also means that you have to integrate with the many third party accounts that your users may want to log in with.
The list of third-party providers is constantly growing, and it's not feasible for a developer to integrate with all of them.
This is where Auth0 comes in.

# What is Auth0?

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a service that allows you to provide user authentication in your applications while offloading the complexity of integrating with third-party providers.
With Auth0, you can provide social logins, as well as traditional username and password logins.
Auth0 is a paid service for larger applications, and you will need to consider the cost of using it.
But for smaller applications, Auth0 provides a free tier that allows you to use their service under a certain number of users.

# Integrating Auth0 

Integrating Auth0 is fairly straightforward, and they even provide personalized instructions for a large number of frameworks and programming languages.
For our notes-taking application, we will be using the [Auth0 Next.js Quickstart Guide](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login).
This post will simply be a rehash of the instructions provided in the guide with some additional notes.

# Setting up Auth0

First, we will need to create an Auth0 account, and then create a new application in the Auth0 dashboard.

Once we have created our application, we will turn to our Next.js application and install the Auth0 SDK as a dependency.
This SDK will allow us to easily integrate Auth0 into our application.

```bash
npm install @auth0/nextjs-auth0

# or

yarn add @auth0/nextjs-auth0
```

Next, we will need to configure our application to use Auth0.
For development, we will need to create a `.env.local` file at the root of our project.
For production, we will use environment variables instead.

<CodeTitle name=".env.local" language="file" />
```bash
AUTH0_SECRET=''
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=''
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=''
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=''
```

The `AUTH0_SECRET` is a random string that should be generated using the following terminal command.
You will have to install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) if you don't already have it installed, you may need to do some research on how to do this with your operating system.

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Now that we have our `.env.local` file, we can create the following API route that will handle the authentication.

<Directory name="next-app" expanded={true}>
    <Directory name="pages" expanded={true}>
        <Directory name="api" expanded={true}>
            <Directory name="auth" expanded={true}>
                <Directory name="[...auth0].tsx" icon="/images/icons/languages/react.svg" />
            </Directory>
        </Directory>
        <Directory name="index.tsx" icon="/images/icons/languages/react.svg" />
        <Directory name="_app.tsx" icon="/images/icons/languages/react.svg" />
    </Directory>
    <Directory name=".env.local" icon="/images/icons/languages/file.svg" />
</Directory>

<CodeTitle name="[...auth0].tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { handleAuth } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0"

export default handleAuth()
```

For our application to have access to a user's session, we will need to wrap our application in the `UserProvider` context provided by the Auth0 SDK.

<CodeTitle name="_app.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { AppProps } from "next/app"
import { UserProvider } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {
	return <Component {...pageProps} />
	return (
		<UserProvider>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</UserProvider>
	)
}

export default App
```

And that's it! All we need to do now is add a login/logout button to our application and we are done.
Here's a really simple example of how to do this.

<CodeTitle name="index.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { useUser } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"
import { NextPage } from "next"

const IndexPage: NextPage = () => {
	const { user } = useUser()

	return user ? (
		<a href="/api/auth/logout">Logout</a>
	) : (
		<a href="/api/auth/login">Login</a>
	)
}

export default IndexPage
```

Here we leverage the `useUser` hook provided by the Auth0 SDK to get the current user's session and display a login or logout link accordingly.

# Protecting Pages  

Now that we have a means of authenticating users, we will want to protect certain pages in our application.
For example, we may want to protect a user profile page, or in our case, the notes editor page.

Let's say we want to protect the following page in our application. We built this page in [Devlog #5](/devlog-5).

<CodeTitle name="editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import Editor from "@/components/Editor/Editor"
import { NextPage } from "next"

const EditorPage: NextPage = () => {
    return <Editor />
}

export default EditorPage
```

To protect this page, we can use the `withPageAuthRequired` function provided by the Auth0 SDK.
We assign this function to our `getServerSideProps` function like so.

<CodeTitle name="editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import Editor from "@/components/Editor/Editor"
import { GetServerSideProps, NextPage } from "next"
import { withPageAuthRequired } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"

const EditorPage: NextPage = () => {
    return <Editor />
}

export default EditorPage

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = withPageAuthRequired()
```

Now, when a user tries to access the editor page, if they are not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page.
If we want to access the user's session within our editor page, we can simply take in the `user` prop as a parameter, like so.

<CodeTitle name="editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import Editor from "@/components/Editor/Editor"
import { GetServerSideProps, NextPage } from "next"
import { UserProfile } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"
import { withPageAuthRequired } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"

interface EditorPageProps {
    user: UserProfile
}

const EditorPage: NextPage = ({ user }) => {
    return <Editor />
}

export default EditorPage

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = withPageAuthRequired()
```

# Protecting API Routes

Now that we have protected our front-facing pages, we will want to protect our API routes as well.
For example, we may want to protect our API route that handles fetching and saving a user's notes.

Let's say we want to protect the following API route in our application.

<CodeTitle name="user.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
async function user(req, res) {
    ...
}

export default user
```

We can use the `withApiAuthRequired` function and wrap our API route like so.


<CodeTitle name="user.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
import { withApiAuthRequired } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client"

export default withApiAuthRequired(async function user(req, res) {
    ...
})
```

Now, when a request is made to this API route, if the user is not authenticated, they will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

# Next Connections

This week marks the start of integrating our notes taking application with the many API services we will be using. 
Authentication is the first step in this process which the rest of the application will rely on.
On the horizon, we have our database connection for storing user data like our notes.

Until then.
