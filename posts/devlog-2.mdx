# Keeping Tabs

Tabbed systems are a very common UI pattern for displaying multiple pieces of information in a single view.
The very browser you're reading this from utilizes a tabbed system to display separate pages.
A tabbed system allows a user to quickly switch between different pieces of information without the need to navigate between pages.
For communicating code, a tabbed system is a great way to distinguish between different files and pieces of code.
[Last week](/devlog-1), we implemented a **CodeTitle** component that allows us to display the name of a file like an IDE.
This week, we complete the IDE experience by implementing a tabbed system for displaying code (or anything).

To get started, we'll need a component that can take in multiple child components and display them accordingly.
We'll call this component **TabbedView** and it will take in a **labels** prop that determines whether or not we are providing custom labels as children.
For the sake of exposition, we'll assume that the labels prop is always true, but you can easily modify the code to support built-in numeric labels as well.

<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Children, FC, PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"

interface TabbedViewProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    labels?: boolean
}
const TabbedView: FC<TabbedViewProps> = (props) => {
    const childArray = Children.toArray(props.children)
    // Here we assume that every child is a label
    // directly followed by its corresponding content
    const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(1)
}
```

Now that we have a component that can take in multiple children, we need to figure out how to display them correctly.
Notice that every label child in our array of children is in an even index $k$ including $0$.
This means to find every label, we can simply filter the array of children by even indices.

```ts
// This will leave us with an array of just labels
childArray.filter((child, index) => index % 2 === 0)
```

Knowing where the labels are is great, but we also need to know where the corresponding content for each label is.
We know that the content for a label is always in the next index, so we can simply add $1$ to our labels' indices.
However, we need to be careful here, since JavaScript's [Array.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
will return a new reduced array. This means we have to determine the original index in our new array.
We can do this by reversing our filter calculation and then incrementing 1, as such. 
This calculated index will be used in an **onClick** function to set the corresponding active tag.

```tsx
childArray.filter((child, index) => index % 2 === 0)
    .map((Label, index) => (
        <button>
          key={index}
          onClick={(e) => {
            // Reverse our filter calculation and increment 1
            setActiveTab(index * 2 + 1)
          }}
          {Label}
        </button>
    )
```

Let's put it all together. I will also give elements some CSS classes for better comprehension.

<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Children, FC, PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./TabbedView.module.css"

interface TabbedViewProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    labels?: boolean
}
const TabbedView: FC<TabbedViewProps> = (props) => {
    const childArray = Children.toArray(props.children)
    const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(1)

    return (
        <>
          <div className={styles.selectContainer}>
            {childArray.filter((child, index) => index % 2 === 0)
                .map((Label, index) => (
                    <button
                      key={index}
                      onClick={(e) => {
                        // Reverse our filter calculation and increment 1
                        setActiveTab(index * 2 + 1)
                      }}
                      className={styles.label}
                    >
                      {Label}
                    </button>
                )
            }
            </div>
            {/* Here we render the content for the active tab */}
            <div className={styles.contentContainer}>
              {childArray[activeTab]}
            </div>
        </>
    )
}

export default TabbedView
```

And that's it! We now have a tabbed system that can display any number of labels and corresponding content (assuming the CSS is in order).
Here's a demo of the tabbed system in action with the component we just created and how it's written up in MDX, which is how posts like this are written.

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Children, FC, PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./TabbedView.module.css"

interface TabbedViewProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    labels?: boolean
}

const TabbedView: FC<TabbedViewProps> = (props) => {
    const childArray = Children.toArray(props.children)
    const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(1)

    return (
        <>
          <div className={styles.selectContainer}>
            {childArray.filter((child, index) => index % 2 === 0)
                .map((Label, index) => (
                    <button
                      key={index}
                      onClick={(e) => {
                        // Reverse our filter calculation and increment 1
                        setActiveTab(index * 2 + 1)
                      }}
                      className={styles.label}
                    >
                      {Label}
                    </button>
                )
            }
            </div>
            {/* Here we render the content for the active tab */}
            <div className={styles.contentContainer}>
              {childArray[activeTab]}
            </div>
        </>
    )
}

export default TabbedView
```
<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.module.css" language="css" />
```css
.selectContainer {
    background-color: var(--bg-code);
    border-top-left-radius: 5px;
    border-top-right-radius: 5px;
    transition: var(---theme-change-transition);
    padding-left: 0.25rem;
    padding-right: 0.25rem;
    padding-top: 5px;
    display: flex;
    overflow-y: auto;
    padding-bottom: 5px;
    width: fit-content;
    z-index: 3;
}

.label {
    background: inherit;
    border: inherit;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    cursor: pointer;
    min-width: 20%;
    border-bottom: 1px solid transparent;
    margin-right: 1rem;
}

.label:hover {
    border-color: var(--text-color-primary);
}

.contentContainer {
    padding-top: 5px;
    padding-left: 5px;
    padding-right: 5px;
    padding-bottom: 1rem;
}
```
<CodeTitle name="example.mdx" language="mdx" />
````md
<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { Children, FC, PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./TabbedView.module.css"

interface TabbedViewProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    labels?: boolean
}

...
```
<CodeTitle name="TabbedView.module.css." language="css" />
```css
.selectContainer {
    background-color: var(--bg-code);
    border-top-left-radius: 5px;
    border-top-right-radius: 5px;
    transition: var(---theme-change-transition);
    padding-left: 0.25rem;
    padding-right: 0.25rem;
    padding-top: 5px;
    display: flex;
    overflow-y: auto;
    padding-bottom: 5px;
    width: fit-content;
    z-index: 3;
}

...
```
</TabbedView>
````
</TabbedView>

The following snippet of code is rather useful if you want styling for your currently active tab.
In your CSS, simply style the element with the **#active** id accordingly.
```tsx
    onClick={(e) => {
        setActiveTab(index * 2 + 1)
        document
          .querySelectorAll(`#${styles.activeTab}`)
          .forEach((el) => {
            el.id = ""
          })
        e.currentTarget.id = styles.activeTab
    }}
    id={
        index === (activeTab - 1) / 2 ? styles.activeTab : ""
    }
```

# A Pretty Unexpected Difficulty

While working on the **TabbedView** component, I ran into a rather unexpected issue.
Surprisingly enough, the issue was not related to the component itself, but rather the way [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formats my MDX files.
In an MDX file with opening and closing JSX tags, Prettier would automatically format the code incorrectly.
This would cause the code to not render properly, as the whitespace-sensitive text would be broken up into multiple lines.
For example, the following code:

<CodeTitle name="example.mdx" language="mdx" />
````md
<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="example.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
console.log("Hello World")
```
<CodeTitle name="example.py" language="python" />
```py
print("Hello World")
```
</TabbedView>
````

would be formatted by Prettier into the following:

<CodeTitle name="example.mdx" language="mdx" />
````md
<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="example.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts console.log("Hello World") ```
<CodeTitle name="example.py" language="python" />
```py print("Hello World") ```
</TabbedView>
````

This would cause the code to render like so:

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="example.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts console.log("Hello World") ```
<CodeTitle name="example.py" language="python" />
```py print("Hello World") ```
</TabbedView>
instead of the intended result of:

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="example.ts" language="typescript" />
```ts
console.log("Hello World")
```
<CodeTitle name="example.py" language="python" />
```py
print("Hello World")
```
</TabbedView>

After some investigation, I found out that the issue was not entirely Prettier's fault, but rather how my code is syntax highlighted by unified's MDX plugin.
It seems that the plugin doesn't play well with JSX tags, even though JSX is the selling point of MDX.
Unfortunately, I did not have much time this week to investigate the issue further, so I decided to simply disable Prettier for MDX files for now.

<CodeTitle name=".prettierrc" language="prettier" />
```text
*.mdx
```

# The Plan 

The plan for next week is to finally tackle those loose ends mentioned in previous posts, like reworking the navigation bar.
It would also appear that tackling a custom MDX editor may need to be moved up on the priority list.
Other than that, I would like to revisit old code and clean it up a bit, as well as start work on the next component.

Until then.
