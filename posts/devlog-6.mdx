While we have been spending some time planning and working through the note-taking app project, this week, 
I have finally gotten around to cleaning up the codebase for this blog. 
This is a long overdue task, and will certainly take multiple weeks (not all in a row) to complete.
Of course, cleaning code is a never-ending task, but it is pertinent to start now before it becomes too much of a mess.

The first step is to transition from using CSS modules to [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

# Why styled-components?

I have been using CSS modules for a while now, and I have been quite happy with it.
They provide a nice way to scope CSS to a component and are a natural transition from normal CSS since they are just normal CSS files.
However, the main issue with CSS modules is that they quickly become a mess, especially with many components each with its own CSS file.

That's where styled-components come in. styled-components and its cousins (emotion, etc.) are CSS-in-JS libraries.
They allow you to write, as the name suggests, CSS in JavaScript, and then use it in your components.

The main benefit of this is that in React, your HTML markup, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic can all be in the same file.
This makes it much easier to see work on a component since you don't have to switch between multiple files.
Although, this in itself can be a problem, as your component files can become quite large.

Another benefit of many CSS-in-JS libraries is that they allow you to utilize JavaScript logic in your CSS. 
This is especially useful for things like theming, where you can change the CSS based on the current theme based on a variable.
This is something that CSS modules can do! However, it is not as easy and often requires finicky workarounds, like conditionally providing a CSS class name.

# Transitioning to styled-components

Luckily for us, the initial transition from CSS modules to styled-components is quite easy. 
A large portion of it is just copying and pasting the CSS from the CSS modules files to the styled-components files.
Let's see an example of this. Here is the code for the theme change button in the header:

<TabbedView labels={true}>
<CodeTitle name="ThemeButton.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import styles from "./ThemeButton.module.css"

const ThemeButton: FC = () => {
	const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
	const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

	useEffect(() => {
		setMounted(true)
	}, [])

	if (!mounted) return null

	return (
		<button
			onClick={() => {
				setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")
			}}
			className={styles.button}
		>
			<img
				src={`/images/icons/${theme}.png`}
				alt=""
				title="Toggle Theme"
				className={styles.image}
				loading="eager"
			/>
		</button>
	)
}

export default ThemeButton
```
<CodeTitle name="ThemeButton.module.css" language="css" />
```css
.button {
    background-color: inherit;
    border: none;
}

.button:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
}

.image {
    height: 2rem;
}
```

</TabbedView>

Let's migrate this to styled-components. First, we need to install styled-components:

```bash
npm install styled-components

# or

yarn add styled-components
```

Now let's start by creating styled components for the button and the image.
In styled-components, we do this through the styled object.

<CodeTitle name="ThemeButton.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import styled from "styled-components"

const Button = styled.button``

const Image = styled.img``
```

Now we can copy over the styling from CSS and put them between the two backticks.

<CodeTitle name="ThemeButton.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import styled from "styled-components"

const Button = styled.button`
    background-color: inherit;
    border: none;

    &:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
    }
`

const Image = styled.img`
    height: 2rem;
`
```

Now we can use these styled components as if they were React components in our JSX.
We can also now remove the CSS class names and the CSS module import.

<CodeTitle name="ThemeButton.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import styled from "styled-components"

const Button = styled.button`
    background-color: inherit;
    border: none;

    &:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
    }
`

const Image = styled.img`
    height: 2rem;
`

const ThemeButton: FC = () => {
    const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
    const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

    useEffect(() => {
        setMounted(true)
    }, [])

    if (!mounted) return null

    return (
        <Button
            onClick={() => {
                setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")
            }}
        >
            <Image
                src={`/images/icons/${theme}.png`}
                alt=""
                title="Toggle Theme"
                loading="eager"
            />
        </Button>
    )
}

export default ThemeButton
```

And that's it! We have successfully migrated from CSS modules to styled-components.
Of course, this is just a simple example, and there are many more things that we can do with styled-components.
For example, we can use props to change the styling of a component based on a variable. 
We will see this in action in the future when we refactor and optimize certain components for styled-components.

Behind the scenes, I also started work on an important component for future blog posts, a citation component.
Perhaps you will see it in action in some new types of posts soon.

Until then.
