# The Editor

[Last week](/devlog-4), we created a plan for our new note-taking app and set up styled-components in NextJS.
This week, we'll continue our progress by creating the starting text editor for our app.

Let's create a directory for our component and add a new file called **Editor.tsx**:

<Directory name="app" expanded={true}>
    <Directory name="components" expanded={true}>
        <Directory name="Editor" expanded={true}>  
            <Directory name="Editor.tsx" icon="/images/icons/languages/react.svg" />
        </Directory>  
    </Directory>
</Directory>

Our editor will need two parts, an element for users to input text and a component that renders that text.
Let's start by defining these two elements as styled-components. Let's also create a container element.

<CodeTitle name="Editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx 
import styled from "styled-components"

const StyledEditor = styled.div`
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
`

const StyledTextArea = styled.textarea`
    width: 50%;
    height: 100%;
    resize: none;
    outlines: none;
    padding: 1rem;
`

const StyledTextRender = styled.div`
    width: 50%;
    height: 100%;
    padding: 1rem;
`
```

Now, we can create the actual editor component:

```tsx
import { FC } from "react"

const Editor: FC = () => {
    return (
        <StyledEditor>
          <StyledTextArea />
          <StyledTextRender />
        </StyledEditor>
    )
}

export default Editor
```

What's a text editor without the ability to input text? 
Let's create a state variable to store the text that our users will input.

```tsx
import { FC, useState } from "react"

const Editor: FC = () => {
    const [text, setText] = useState("")

    return (
        <StyledEditor>
          <StyledTextArea 
            value={text}
            onChange={(e) => setText(e.currentTarget.value)}
          />
          <StyledTextRender />
        </StyledEditor>
    )
}
```

Now, we can render the text that our users input in the textarea element as follows.

```tsx
return (
    <StyledEditor>
      <StyledTextArea 
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <StyledTextRender>
        {text}
      </StyledTextRender>
    </StyledEditor>
}
```

However, this way of rendering text doesn't allow us to use any of the markdown syntax that we want to support.
We'll need to use a library to parse our inputs and render markdown as HTML.
Luckily for us, [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) provides us with everything we need.

Let's install the library and add it to our component.

```bash
npm install react-markdown

# or 

yarn add react-markdown
```

<CodeTitle name="Editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import { FC, useState } from "react"
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown"

const Editor: FC = () => {
    const [text, setText] = useState("")

    return (
        <StyledEditor>
          <StyledTextArea 
            value={text}
            onChange={(e) => setText(e.currentTarget.value)}
          />
          <StyledTextRender>
            <ReactMarkdown>
              {text}
            </ReactMarkdown>
          </StyledTextRender>
        </StyledEditor>
    )
}
```

Now, we can take any markdown input and render it as HTML.

We can also provide rehype and remark plugins to customize the way our markdown is parsed and rendered.
For example, we can add [rehype-prism-plus]() to add syntax highlighting to highlight code blocks, much like the one below.

```bash
npm install rehype-prism-plus

# or

yarn add rehype-prism-plus
```

<CodeTitle name="Editor.tsx" language="react" />
```tsx
import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus"
...

return (
    <StyledEditor>
      <StyledTextArea 
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <StyledTextRender>
        <ReactMarkdown
          rehypePlugins={[
            [rehypePrism, { ignoreMissing: true }]
          ]}
        >
          {text}
        </ReactMarkdown>
      </StyledTextRender>
    </StyledEditor>
)
```

Other plugins like [rehype-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex) and [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) can be added similarly.

Note that many of these plugins may require additional dependencies or custom CSS to work properly.
For example, rehype-katex requires the following CSS stylesheet to be added to function properly.

```html
<link 
    rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.css"
    integrity="sha384-Xi8rHCmBmhbuyyhbI88391ZKP2dmfnOl4rT9ZfRI7mLTdk1wblIUnrIq35nqwEvC"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

# Conclusion

While this week's devlog was short, we were able to create a basic text editor that supports markdown syntax.
Behind the scenes, we also added a few more improvements to this blog, such as having cards for each category and pages for specific posts in each category.
Next week, we'll add some important features to our editor, such as user tooling.

Until then.
